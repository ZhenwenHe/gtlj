Welcome to Apache Lucene
The Apache LuceneTM project develops open-source search software, including:
	Lucene Core, our flagship sub-project, provides Java-based indexing and search technology, as well as spellchecking, hit highlighting and advanced analysis/tokenization capabilities.
	SolrTM is a high performance search server built using Lucene Core, with XML/HTTP and JSON/Python/Ruby APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search, caching, replication, and a web admin interface.
	PyLucene is a Python wrapper around the Core project.
